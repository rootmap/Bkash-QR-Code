    <h2>Textbox.io 2.0.0.171</h2>
<h3>Please Note</h3>
<ul>
<li>Significant changes have been made to Textbox.io image management in this release. See our <a href="http://docs.ephox.com/display/tbio/Working+with+Images">Working with Images</a> article for more information.
        <ul>
          <li>Inserted images no longer upload automatically as Image Editing is on by default. Disabling Image Editing restores automatic uploads.</li>
          <li>Editing images on remote servers requires a proxy to workaround CORS restrictions. A proxy implementation that is limited to image mime types is available in the Textbox.io SDK with services included.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
<li>The minimum browser version for Textbox.io has increased on three platforms. The editor will fail to load on older versions, use the <a href="http://docs.ephox.com/display/tbio/isSupported">isSupported</a> API to degrade gracefully.  The full list of supported browsers is available in the <a href="http://docs.ephox.com/display/tbio/System+Requirements">System Requirements</a> document on our website.
        <ul>
          <li>Internet Explorer 11</li>
          <li>OS X Safari 9</li>
          <li>iOS (Safari) 9</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
<li>When pasting HTML content the default style retention behaviour of the editor has been changed to preserve styles. If the <a href="http://docs.ephox.com/display/tbio14/paste">paste</a> option has been set in your configuration, this will have no effect.</li>
<li>The mobile editor UI currently renders on top of all other page elements and blocks touch events outside of the editor. Using a custom button to open a dialog can block user input on mobile.</li>
</ul>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>New Image Editing tool
        <ul>
          <li>Flip, Rotate, Crop, Resample</li>
          <li>When an image is selected editing tools appear in the toolbar and on the context menu</li>
          <li>Optional resize large inserted images. The maximum image size can be configured using the <a href="http://docs.ephox.com/display/tbio/images">images</a> configuration setting.</li>
          <li>To disable image editing, set the enabled property of the <a href="http://docs.ephox.com/display/tbio/images">images</a> configuration setting to false</li>
          <li>Use the <a href="http://docs.ephox.com/display/tbio/images">images</a> configuration setting to specify a proxy for editing remote images.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
<li>New Accessibility checking tool
        <ul>
          <li>Simple UI that focuses on enabling end users to understand accessibility issues</li>

      </li>
<li>Core editor download size has been significantly reduced (by over 50%) by extracting packaged resources into separate files</li>
<li>Android is supported. The minimum supported version is Android 5 but Textbox.io will work on version 4 using the current release of Chrome.</li>
<li>Microsoft Edge is now supported</li>
<li>Editor theme CSS can now be adjusted with your choice of colors. A tool to build custom stylesheets is included with the SDK in the <span style="font-family: monospace">theme</span> folder. For more information see our <a href="http://docs.ephox.com/display/tbio/Customizing+the+User+Interface+Colors">Customizing the User Interface Colors</a> article.</li>
<li>Greatly improved Mobile UI stability and consistency
        <ul>
          <li>iOS toolbar is now very stable. Instead of hiding itself when scrolling, it only vanishes when the keyboard opens and comes back after a second</li>
          <li>Small screen phones now have a unique user interface. On phone-sized devices the editor will flatten menus into the toolbar and enable horizontal scrolling instead of using a more drawer. Features and dialogs that do not fit on the screen are automatically disabled.</li>

          <li>Insert Link uses an in-toolbar UI similar to find/replace</li>
          <li>Insert Media uses an in-toolbar UI similar to find/replace</li>
          <li>Font Size uses an in-toolbar UI similar to find/replace</li>
          <li>Pinch gesture can now be used to resize images</li>
          <li>When the keyboard closes and the editor loses focus a light blue highlight indicates where the editor selection is</li>
          <li>Reduced the amount of content scrolling when typing or performing toolbar operations</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
<li>CORS is no longer required to load help dialog contents</li>
<li>New <a href="http://docs.ephox.com/display/tbio/paste">enableFlashImport</a> configuration option to turn off the Flash component of pasting images from Microsoft Word</li>
</ul>
